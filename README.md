# tinder_dog_app

This is part of the Scrimba projects, and the objective was to put into practice the different skills using classes and methods. This app allows the user to select whether it likes the other user.

The buttons in the nav section are not intended to be active, since the task was to work with the logic of the main area. Since this is an app, the recommendation is to see the project on a mobile device. 

This was a solo project, there were no instructions on how to complete this challenge.
